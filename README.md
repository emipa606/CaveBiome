Update of Rikikis mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837412700

- Added the map-gens to DeepRim and Z-Levels so some of the features should be visible there.
- French translation added, thanks qux!
- Things should no longer short-circuit in the rain unless built in a cave-well
